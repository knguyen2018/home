        <p>Welcome to my website. I'm working on a thing that can hopefully help everybody. It's really difficult to teach physics, chemistry, and mathematics to students. Everybody learns differently and each person struggles with different aspects. I hope that I can provide helpful resources for students to grow and <i>maybe enjoy</i> the process of learning these subjects</p>

        <p>This is meant more as a supplement than a teaching source, but the way I show things on here will hopefully provide a new point of view when trying to learn concepts. I personally like to visualize things and it's very useful to imagine things moving as it solidifes things in the brain and is just more enjoyable or immersive. Also, the current background isn't mine so I will try to work on that.</p>

        <p>So, this will be a main-content area where I put the important information and main stuff/content... this should hopefully all work smoothly.</p>

        <p>Just testing line breaks and stuff... don't mind this text.</p>

    <div class="column2">
        <p>Ok, so I'm planning on using this as, like, "side text" that can add notes and other important information... this is cool</p>

    <div class="column1">
<p>Now what? Ok, cool this works, I think</p>

<p>I'm gonna add more content so that I actually have to scroll and see what happens.</p>

<p>I don't know exactly how this works</p>
